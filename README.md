My portfolio: https://tony9321.github.io/Tony-s-Personal-Portfolio/

This is my personal portfolio, although it's simple but it helps me learn html, css, js and web develpment better when I was in 10th grade. Feel free to check out my CV and contact me with the email or Linkedin, everything is listed in the website.
